Java Modules:
1. Nothing happens.
2. No, Java cannot impose a limit of unnamed packages, because it may have more than 1 unnamed package but not required to do so.
3. A compilation unit consists of three optional parts, which are package declaration, import declarations, and top level type declarations.
4. Java modulels are closed. We need import a Java package before using it.
5. No, Java doesn't have similar concept.
6. It means that by writing import static, programmers can get access to the static members of the class without writing the class name. This makes code clean and easy to write.
7. It is a compile-time erroe if a top level type declaration contains following access modifiers: protected, private, or static.

Object Oriented Programming in C#
1. A sealed class cannot be inherited by other classes.
2. A partial declaration is used to divide a definition into different parts.
3. Yes, as we can see in page 54.
4. Class modifiers are used to modify declarations of classes. New modifier is used in nested classes, in order to hide the base class members.
5. Properties are a combination of fields and methods. A property has a getter and a setter, and the syntax for accessing fields and properties is the same. The difference between fields and properties is that properties do not denote storage locations.
6. Internal means "access limited to this program", and protected internal means "access limited to this program or types derived from the containing class.
7. Volatile field supports synchronization in multi-threaded programs. With a volatile modifier, we can ensure that every time when we access the field, it is the latest.
8. Subclasses cannot override non-virtual methods in parent classes. However, a virtual method can be overridden, but it's not necessary.
